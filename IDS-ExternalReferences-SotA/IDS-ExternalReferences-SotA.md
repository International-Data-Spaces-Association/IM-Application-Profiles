# Original definitions in different standard vocabularies we reuse in the IDS Infomodel

Based on the definitions in the IDS Infomodel, we look at the original definitions in the respective specifications, such as DCAT, DCTerms, etc., which we summarize in the following table:

| AppEndpointShape        | ids:AppEndpoint         | dct:language               | dct:language is defined for the shapes: Catalog, Dataset, Distribution.
