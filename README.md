# IM-Application-Profiles

We evaluated the state-of-the-art of the IDS InformationModel. More specifically, we looked at the models and the mappings to their validations (SHACL files).
We summarise the findings as follows:

* [IDS-SHACL-SotA](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IM-Application-Profiles/tree/main/IDS-SHACL-SotA/IDS-SHACL-SotA.md), in which we include the mappings from each model to its corresponding SHACL file. Here we provide information about local and external restrictions. Local restrictions refer to those specifically defined in the IDS project. External are those included in the IDS project from existing definitions in other ontologies and vocabularies, such as *ODRL, TIME, SKOS*, etc.

* [IDS-SHACL-AdditionalEvaluation](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IM-Application-Profiles/tree/main/IDS-SHACL-SotA/IDS-SHACL-AdditionalEvaluation.md), in this section, we include information about SHACL shapes in the IDS infomodel, only referring to local (IDS) content. Also, we provide information about those models in the IDS infomodel without SHACL shapes, i.e., without validations.

* [IDS-ExternalReferences-SotA](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IM-Application-Profiles/tree/main/IDS-ExternalReferences-SotA/IDS-ExternalReferences-SotA.md), based on the IDS definitions, we look at the original definitions in the respective specifications, such as *DCAT, DCTerms*, etc.

* [Hierarchical alignment between IDS infomodel and DCATâ€‹ - Examples](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IM-Application-Profiles/tree/main/IDS-ExternalReferences-SotA/HierarchicalAlignment-IDS-DCAT.pdf), we provide a graphical representation of the alignment between the definitions in the IDS infomodel and the DCAT specifications.

Moreover, we provide an example of a resource (a Connector Endpoint) and the corresponding validation in [examples-SHACL-validations](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IM-Application-Profiles/tree/main/examples-SHACL-validations)
